# CreditRiskMachineLearningModel
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the credit risk using the German Credit Dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this model is to estimate whether a person's is likely to have
either a good or bad credit risk based on different financial and demographic factors

## Project Overview
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis
- A Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict credit risk
- Model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix
